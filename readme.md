# Welcome to Carlos' GitHub!

Hi! Nice to see you on my GitHub profile. In this repository you will find the **Tool Provider Decision Matrix Starter Template**.

# Why did I create this spreadsheet?

I created this file as part of my **Marketing Analytics** bootcamp, to choose the right tool based on more accurate approach, using a scale stating all the different variable one can encounter. 

# How it should be used?

This tool can be used for anyone who wants to adquire a new tool, or have considered a substitute. Note that depending on the tool, other variables could be added as well.
